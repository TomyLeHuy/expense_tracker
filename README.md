# Overview
A basic webapp that allows the user to track their expenses and catagorize them accordingly. I created this webapp as an exercise but will extend it later on during my studies by including AI to categotization.

## Running the Project
In order to run the app just open the folder in an IDE of you choice and install the required packages:
''' py
pip install requirements.txt

'''
